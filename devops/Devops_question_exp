3.
What are the different phases of the DevOps lifecycle?

Hide Answer
The DevOps lifecycle is designed to streamline the development process, minimize errors and defects, and ensure that software is delivered to end-users quickly and reliably. The different phases of the DevOps lifecycle are:

Plan: Define project goals, requirements, and resources
Code: Develop and write code
Build: Compile code into executable software
Test: Verify and validate software functionality
Release: Deploy code to the production environment
Deploy: Automated deployment and scaling of software
Operate: Monitor and maintain the software in production
Monitor: Collect and analyze software performance data
Optimize: Continuously improve and evolve the software system

5.
Explain configuration management in DevOps.

Hide Answer
Configuration Management (CM) is a practice in DevOps that involves organizing and maintaining the configuration of software systems and infrastructure. It includes version control, monitoring, and change management of software systems, configurations, and dependencies.

The goal of CM is to ensure that software systems are consistent and reliable to make tracking and managing changes to these systems easier. This helps to minimize downtime, increase efficiency, and ensure that software systems remain up-to-date and secure.

Configuration Management is often performed using tools such as Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack, which automate the process and make it easier to manage complex software systems at scale.
